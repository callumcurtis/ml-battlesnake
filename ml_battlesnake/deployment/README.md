# Deployment

Contains utilities and application code for Battlesnake services and their deployment. This includes the [game engine](game-engine-as-executable), [browser spectator](browser-spectator), and [snakes](snakes).

Note: This directory is a work in progress and is currently intended for local development only. Once machine learning snakes are ready for deployment, this directory will be updated to support more sophisticated deployment scenarios.
